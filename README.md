# CS-210-Project-Three

The project is made to use a input.txt file to get a list of food items, to then allow the user to search through the list of food items to see how many times they are listed in that file. The problem that it solves is a hypothetical company lists food items into a database and then use this program to specifically see all the amounts whether being with numbers or a histogram. This program can also specifically show one item of the user's choosing. The frequency is also listed in a frequency file on opening the program as a backup.

I believe I did particularly well on this project with the use of a struct to instead make a array list instead of using map, I am unsure if map is any more difficult but, I am more used to structs.

I believe that the way I can enhance my code is to have a way to not use arrays because if the limit is every hit then the program will crash, and so to avoid that, I had to use a large array number which is not that good because its using unneccessary memory.

I found it challenging to write the array portion in the Class because I tried to make it not require an array and because it was with syntax I wasn't used too, I was getting errors and so I switched it back to an array. I would like to go back and see what I could do to improve and not need to use an array, I think a good way to find this out is with stackoverflow and youtube as my support networks.

The skill to write neat code will be useful for all my future projects and course works.

I believe the way that I made this code maintainable and readable and adaptable is by seperating the class function into another file. Also using a ton of methods to get out of what I need from my program, It was a very interesting project to solve and I had a ton of fun creating this.
